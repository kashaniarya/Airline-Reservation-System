Breif Summary:
Used Prolog to write an airline reservation system for the Twilight Zone Airlines 
(a fake database of airlines & flights). Given a request to travel from one city to another, 
prints out the flight schedule. For each leg of the trip, prints out the 
departure airport, airport, city name, and time.
